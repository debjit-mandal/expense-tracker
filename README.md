# Expense Tracker
I am a beginner in Go. I have tried to make a Expense tracker. Feel free to suggest any kind of improvement.

To run this code locally:

`sudo git clone https://github.com/debjit-mandal/expense-tracker`

`cd expense-tracker`

`go build Expense-Tracker.go`

`go run Expense-Tracker.go'
